EV Charger Finder

A web application to find nearby compatible chargers for electric vehicles. This project applies front-end development knowledge, integrating APIs and interactive maps to solve a practical problem.


Features:

Features include searching for nearby EV charging stations, displaying results on an interactive map using Leaflet.js, and fetching data from RapidAPI and NinjaAPI. A fallback hard-coded database is also included since most EV databases require paid access.


Limitations:

Limitations include the restricted number of results due to free API usage, limited EV model coverage, and the fact that some of the data may not always be fully up to date.



The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, uses Leaflet.js for maps, and RapidAPI/NinjaAPI for external data.

Future improvements could include expanding supported EV databases, adding filters such as charging speed, connector type, and network, and improving the overall UI/UX. A backend could also be introduced in the future to securely handle API keys.
